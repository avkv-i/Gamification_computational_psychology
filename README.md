<h1>How do humans learn concepts and strategies?</h1>

A joint project, as part of a data analysis research internship at Oxford University, in the field of computational cognitive psychology funded by the Wellcome Biomedical Vacation scholarship scheme, to research into human concept learning using gamification. Co-authored research paper with post-doctoral researcher and showcased findings at the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN) Conference 2023 in a paper titled: How Do Humans Learn Concepts and Strategies?

<b>Abstract: </b> Concepts and strategies have traditionally been the focus of two separate fields of study: one studying the computations underlying representation learning (Behrens et al., 2018) and the other studying the mechanisms underlying planning (Callaway, Hardy, & Griffiths, 2022). But how does the acquisition of concepts depend on their application in strategies? Here, we investigated this question by comparing two training curricula in a grid world game where, to succeed, human participants had to learn new concepts and apply those concepts in strategies. During training, different groups of players experienced the same game rounds in one of two different orders (training curricula): a curriculum prioritising the application of new concepts at a shallow planning depth (concept-first) and a curriculum prioritising applying a single concept in increasingly complex strategies (strategy-first). We found that learning was promoted by the strategy-first curriculum.
